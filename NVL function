For example:

SELECT NVL(supplier_city, 'n/a')
FROM suppliers;
The SQL statement above would return 'n/a' if the supplier_city field contained a null value. Otherwise, it would return the supplier_city value.

Another example using the NVL function in Oracle/PLSQL is:

SELECT supplier_id,
NVL(supplier_desc, supplier_name)
FROM suppliers;
This SQL statement would return the supplier_name field if the supplier_desc contained a null value. Otherwise, it would return the supplier_desc.

A final example using the NVL function in Oracle/PLSQL is:

SELECT NVL(commission, 0)
FROM sales;
This SQL statement would return 0 if the commission field contained a null value. Otherwise, it would return the commission field.
